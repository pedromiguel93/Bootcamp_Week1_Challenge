# Bootcamp_Week1_Challenge

## Description
This project is all about adding extra accessibility to a marketing agency website by providing more direct access for people with disabilities who might need to use screen readers or other assistive technologies, but also to make the website perform better on search engines by refactoring its original code, maintaining all of the original functionality while making the code more easily readable and better performing.
